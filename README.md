# IBM Cloud Pak for Data - Connector SDK

This project allows developers to implement their own connectors to data sources that are not supported out-of-the-box by IBMÂ® Cloud Pak for Data. SDK connectors are based on Apache Arrow Flight. The SDK is primarily designed for developing connectors in Java, but a connector could be developed in any language supported by Apache Arrow Flight provided that the connector adheres to the specification described by the SDK Guide.
